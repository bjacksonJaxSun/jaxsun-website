- [x] All DbSets defined (TimeEntries, Projects, TimeCategories, IdeaSubmissions)
- [x] Proper entity relationships configured in OnModelCreating
- [x] Foreign key constraints and delete behaviors set
- [x] Database indexes configured for performance

### âœ… Program.cs Configuration

## Identified Issues & Fixes Applied

### ðŸ”§ Issue 1: Async/Await in Top-Level Program
**Status:** Needs Review
**Description:** The database initialization code uses await in the top-level program, which requires .NET 6+ top-level statements.
**Current Implementation:** Using top-level statements with async/await
**Risk Level:** Low (ASP.NET Core 8.0 supports this)

### ðŸ”§ Issue 2: Service Registration Order
**Status:** âœ… Correct
**Description:** Entity Framework and Identity services are registered before MVC services.
**Verification:** Order is correct in Program.cs

### ðŸ”§ Issue 3: Navigation Property Initialization
**Status:** âœ… Correct
**Description:** Virtual navigation properties properly initialized with empty collections.
**Verification:** All models have proper initialization

## Manual Testing Required

### Build & Startup Tests
1. **Build Project**
   ```bash
   dotnet clean
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```
   **Expected:** No compilation errors

2. **Database Creation Test**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   **Expected:** 
   - Application starts successfully
   - SQLite database file created (JaxSun.db)
   - No startup exceptions

3. **Database Schema Verification**
   **Expected Tables:**
   - AspNetUsers, AspNetRoles, AspNetUserRoles (Identity)
   - TimeEntries, Projects, TimeCategories, IdeaSubmissions

### Functional Tests

4. **User Registration Test**
   - Navigate to `/Identity/Account/Register`
   - Create test user account
   - **Expected:** User created successfully

5. **User Login Test**
   - Navigate to `/Identity/Account/Login`
   - Login with test credentials
   - **Expected:** Authentication successful

6. **Role Seeding Test**
   - Check database for Admin and Partner roles
   - **Expected:** Both roles present in AspNetRoles table

7. **Category Seeding Test**
   - Check TimeCategories table
   - **Expected:** 8 default categories with colors

8. **JSON Migration Test**
   - If submissions.json exists in Data folder
   - **Expected:** Data migrated to IdeaSubmissions table

9. **Existing Functionality Test**
   - Test all existing controllers (Home, About, Contact, etc.)
   - **Expected:** All existing features work unchanged

## Performance Tests

10. **Database Connection Test**
    - Multiple page loads
    - **Expected:** No connection errors or timeouts

11. **Identity UI Performance**
    - Login/logout operations
    - **Expected:** Responsive UI, no delays

## Security Tests

12. **Authorization Test**
    - Access protected areas without login
    - **Expected:** Redirect to login page

13. **Password Policy Test**
    - Try weak passwords during registration
    - **Expected:** Validation errors for weak passwords

## Success Criteria

âœ… **All tests pass without errors**
âœ… **Database created and seeded properly**  
âœ… **User authentication working**
âœ… **Existing functionality preserved**
âœ… **No security vulnerabilities introduced**

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Errors
- **NuGet restore issues:** Delete bin/obj folders, restore packages
- **Version conflicts:** Ensure all packages use version 8.0.0
- **Missing references:** Verify all using statements

### Runtime Errors
- **Database connection:** Check connection string format
- **Identity configuration:** Verify middleware order
- **Seeding failures:** Check for data conflicts

### Performance Issues
- **Slow startup:** Normal on first run (database creation)
- **Memory usage:** Monitor for connection leaks
